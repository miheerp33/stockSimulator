# stockSimulator
A simulator for stocks
This is a project to learn how to use YFinance and PySimpleGui well.

2/20/2022 I am not sure exactly where the problem is but somewhere in the program it must be creating a new table every time the program runs. When I run the program, none of the data saves between runs. This defeats the purpose of using SQL because in it's current state, you would have to leave the program running permanently so you can actually 'profit'

2/21/2022 I have realized that you must commit the updates or inserts into a database which makes this project functionally complete. I am currently testing it by purchasing some stocks which I will sell in a few days.
